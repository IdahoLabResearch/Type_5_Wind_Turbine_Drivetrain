Please follow these steps.

1. Run the file "add_paths.m"
2. From example folder Run "run_5mw_drivetrain_stand_alone_example.m"
3. Run "Type_5_Torque_Converter_Initialization.m" file to initialize the torque converter model. 
4. Run "AB_load_data.m" file
5. Run "AB_init.m" file (make sure you have interp.m file in the same folder)
6. You can open the "Type_5_Wind_Turbine_Drivetrain_Simulink_Model". 
7. In simulink, go to modelling tab, click model settings and then model properties, click callbacks tab and then initFcn* and insert this in Model initialization function:

Ts =2.5e-5;

R_pu = 0.005;
X_pu = 0.03;
B_pu = 0.00275;

Z_161 = 259.21;
Z_44 = 19.36;
Z_46 = 237.75;
Z_12_47 = 17.47;

AB_load_data;
AB_init;  


8. Run the simulink model "Type_5_Wind_Turbine_Drivetrain_Simulink_Model".
