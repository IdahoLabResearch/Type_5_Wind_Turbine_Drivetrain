# Type_5_Wind_Turbine_Drivetrain
The purpose of this code is to provide a high-fidelity model of Type-5 wind turbine drivetrain for grid integration and transient stability studies. 
## This drivetrain contains a simplified gearbox model, but the detailed version can be developed following Juan F. Gallego-Calderon, “Electromechanical Drivetrain Simulation”, Dissertation (2015) [Link: https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/electromechanical-drivetrain-simulation ]."
